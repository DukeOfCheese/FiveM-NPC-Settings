# chroma-toggleableNPC - FiveM
Simple & straight forward toggleable NPC script with commands for your server administrators to turn on/off at will
Gets rid of useless loops on the client and disables / enables AI with a simple one-time function.

## Dependencies
None - Standalone

The default permission ace for this command is `toggle-npc` - you can give this to a group such as:
`add_ace group.admin toggle-npc allow`

If you want to edit the permissions check such as for jobs or your framework, edit the `config.lua`
You can also edit the notification function to integrate your server's notification script - by default it just uses chat messages.
